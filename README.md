# Climate-Change
This repository compiles a set of R Scripts to do a climate change analysis using 5 algorithms of Species Distribution Models through sdm R package platform and using multivariate analyses

The first code call: _SDM_main_code is the main code for the whole analysis. I recommend use a server at least with 20 GB of RAM.

the code automatizes the preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, ensemble and geographical analysis using R enviroment and high performance computation through several parallelization steps
